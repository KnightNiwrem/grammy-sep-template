Research deeply about grammy and its StorageAdapter interface. As part of your research, look at the github repository `@grammyjs/conversations` which is an example of a plugin library that uses the StorageAdapter interface. Then implement this project, which will serve as a starter template for future plugins for grammy that uses the StorageAdapter interface. This starter template has nothing to do with sessions, will not use sessions, and will not mention sessions anywhere. Do not update @.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml and do not try to be overly ambitious. This is just a starter template to build new StorageAdapter enabled grammy plugins from. When done, commit and push.
